# Structure

1. This project is made with Eclipse's Dynamic Web Module Option which does the heavy lifting for us
2. .jsp files can be appended within the webapp directory as needed (no need to put them in META-INF or WEB-INF)
3. servlet files are .java files that will handle the logic and should be placed in java folder within the main directory

# Important to know logic

1. JSP is the frontend and will send a request to some servlet via the annotation
2. Servlet files will create a connection through mysql jar file and will send in a query
3. The response is also handled in the Servlet file
